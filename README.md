# Guess The Number

This is a simple number guessing game made with Python and Tkinter. The player needs to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number and can choose from different difficulty levels.

## Why Tkinter?

You might be wondering why Tkinter was used to make a game. Well, sometimes you just want to have a bit of fun and experiment with different tools. Tkinter might not be the most common choice for game development, but it can handle simple games like this quite well!

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, for helping to solve error codes and improve the game. Having a language model assist with the development process was a unique experience!
